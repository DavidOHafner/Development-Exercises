Assume, to reach a contradiction, that there exists a greatest prime number p.
Consider the finite set of all primes P = {2, 3, ..., p}.
Let q equal 1 plus the product of all elements in p.
For every prime r in P, q = rn + 1 for some integer n. Specifically, n is the product of all elements in P except for r.
For every prime r in P, q is equivalent to 1 mod r, and therefore, q is not divisible by r.
q is not divisible by any prime, and is, therefore prime.
q is larger than p.
p is not the greatest prime number.
We have reached a contradiction, and therefore the original hypothesis must be false.
There does not exist a greatest prime number p.
