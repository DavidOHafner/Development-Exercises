Let $B=\{a^nbub^n | n>=2$ and $u \in \{a,b\}\mbox{*}\}$.

For all pumping lengths $p$, let $s = a^{p+2} b a b^{p+2}$. $s$ is in the language $B$ and has a length greater than $p$. For all partitions $s = xyz$ satisfying $|xy| <= p$ and $|y| > 0$, $xy^0z$ is of the form $a^mbab^n$ where $m < n$ and is therefore not in the language $B$.

By the converse of the pumping lemma, $B$ is not regular.
