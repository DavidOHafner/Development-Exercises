For all regular languages $L$ a finite automaton $M = (Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$ exists which recognizes $L$. $M' = (Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,Q\setminus F)$ recognizes the complement of $L$ because every string which ends in an accepting state in $M$ does not end in an accepting state in $M'$ and vice versa. Therefore, the class of regular languages is closed under complementation.
